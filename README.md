### 1-Description :page\_facing\_up:

This is a description of a project that I have completed that focuses on a specific technology with other supporting technologies that I have already learned. This description should give you a good idea of what the project does in plan, design and implementation. How does it help improve the user's life? What is the overall purpose of the work? If I were to leave the project today what would people need to know about the idea in order to maintain the project
